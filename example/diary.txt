Okay here goes. It's time to talk about all the most sensitive things in my life.
If anybody finds this my life is over.

First off, the other day somebody said 'how are you going?' and I replied 'not bad' but then in the heat of the moment I forgot to ask them how they were going.

I have not spoken to that person since because I'm too scared of reinitiating conversation.

Second thing, I was the one who ate the chocolate pudding before it was served at christmas lunch. I blamed it on my brother. God forgive me.

I think the FBI is after me. I keep getting random calls to my phone and I'm too scared to pick them up. I think they're onto me. I have no idea what I did to wrong them but I'm convinced that at some point I was a spy and I had to wipe my memory to prevent being tortured into spilling intel, and now I'm left with minimum recollection of the past and maximum fear for the future. I've considered approaching them and explaining my situation but I don't want to get indicted for treason in case they actually weren't looking into my spy history in the first place.

Last but not least, I sometimes fantasise about being a windows 95 manual. There is something comforting about the thought. I think I was meant to be one, but for some reason I'm stuck in the body of a human. I suspect I'm not the only human who feels that way. But it's hard to find others like me because I'm afraid of being ridiculed by my peers who think it's weird. I've brought it up in anonymous message boards but my post quickly gets buried and ignored. At this point any engagement with my ideas, positive or negative, would be welcomed. But I get nothing. I don't understand why the world is like this, but us windows 95 manuals stuck in human bodies need to do what we can to get through it all.
